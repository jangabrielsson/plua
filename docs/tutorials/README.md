## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorials, ensure you have:

1. **PLua Installed**:
   ```bash
   # Global installation (recommended)
   pip install plua
   
   # Verify installation
   plua --version
   ```

2. **Development Environment**:
   - **VS Code** with [Lua MobDebug adapter](../VSCode.md) (recommended)
   - **ZeroBrane Studio** with [PLua integration](../Zerobrane.md)
   - Or any text editor with Lua syntax highlighting

3. **Basic Lua Knowledge** (helpful but not required):
   - Variables and basic data types
   - Control structures (if/then, loops)
   - Basic function concepts

### Quick Setup

1. **Initialize a QuickApp project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-quickapp
   cd my-quickapp
   plua --init-qa
   ```

2. **Test your setup**:
   ```bash
   # Run with Fibaro SDK
   plua --fibaro main.lua
   ```

3. **Open in your editor** and start with Part 1!

## 📖 How to Use These Tutorials
